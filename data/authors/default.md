- [**Whitespace Language Decoder**](https://github.com/ArcusTen/whitespace-language) - This Python tool is a decoder for the Whitespace language. Whitespace is an esoteric programming language where the only characters that are considered by the interpreter are spaces, tabs, and linefeeds. Any other characters are ignored, making the code visually obscure.
- [**Image Overlay Tool**](https://github.com/ArcusTen/Decoders/tree/main/Image-Overlay-Python-Tool) - A simple command-line utility that combines two images by overlaying their pixel values. The tool takes two input images and generates a new image where each pixel's RGB values are the sum of the corresponding pixels from the input images, modulo 256. This creates an overlay effect, blending the two images at a binary level.
